                <p>What's better than a good cold drink of beer, wine and/or liquor after a tiring work,becoming someone who
                    serves beer, wine and liquor.You play as a bartender , Jill Stingray , in a bar name VA-11 HA-11-A. As
                    Jill keeps listening and attracting "fascinating" clientele hearing about their weird chaotic life in
                    Glitch City as she serves them drinks. This games potray a quite a sum of characters that are simple
                    in personality but with and their own struggle can really make me or most of us relate to the characters,
                    is the second most important thing in a story, which is what this game did well. Interacting with a variety
                    of characters in VA-11 has been the most fun I had in a while. Eventhough they are fictional characters,
                    you can still feel their struggle in Glitch City as technology has progress significantly and android
                    are ubiquitous, Not to say that the game has awesome pixel art and AMAZING soundtracks whilst also needing
                    memory skills so that you will be able to decipher vague customer orders. Most importantly, Dogs in this
                    game can speak and catgirls are real(Hooray to real life catgirls :D ).</p>
