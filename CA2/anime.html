                <h1>From the new world</h1>
                <div class="float-image">

                <p> Imagine a world where a small percentage of human is able to use psychokinesis(PK user), however the rest
                    of humanity cannot condone such a different and unknown creature,This induced fear causes a public outcry
                    to eliminate the PK user which in the end follows a downfall of civilisation, one century later, we follow
                    the story of Shun, Saki, Maria, Satoru and Mamoru. As weird events unfold in their eye and they find
                    outs the truth of the society they live in . This show clearly depicts humanity's fear of the unknown
                    as a whole and how they response to the unknown. Accompanying that with a eery soundtrack and with horror
                    elements really makes this show stands out from other. There is this mixed emotion I have after watching
                    the show it's hard to explain it really makes you wonder about the humanity, whether we are just a bunch
                    of horrible nuts or this is just how nature made us to be.You can really feel the humanity's typical
                    distaste towards human of different kinds and will do anything neccesary to eradicate them if push comes
                    to shove, all in the name of protecting humanity.</p>

                <h1>Gravity falls</h1>

                <p> Summer vacation is here and Dipper and Mabel are drop off at the town of Gravity Falls on their Great Uncle
                    Stan Pines , who runs a place called Mystery Shack where he shill customer with faux mystical item.However
                    it seems like gravity falls has its own real myth to be unfold. While this show tends toward a younger
                    audience, This cartoon by no means a shallow series. It has plot twist that is hinted throughout the
                    show and strong comedy and moral theme that will be a good influence for kids watching, even adults too
                    in my opinion.</p>

                <h1>Aria</h1>
                <div class="float-image">

                <p> Humanity has successfully colonize Aqua aka Mars and made it into a beautiful water city call Venezia(name
                    inspired by Venice).While this sounds like this show has a heavy sci-fi element,it has but only paltry
                    influence on the show as a whole. This anime focuses more on the lifes of 3 Undines, Akari, Aika and
                    Alice with their mentor Alicia, Akira and Athena. Undine are pretty much tour gondola rowers similar
                    to the one in Venice here on Earth. The whole plot of the anime is just to show these 3 characters striving
                    to become a full-fledge Undine and one day be able to fetch real tourist.While that is general plot of
                    the show,due to the episodic nature of the anime,we meet various other residents of Aqua and strange
                    phenomenon happening in the city. This show really did well in providing comfort and warmth with it's
                    chill soundtrack and a calming opening theme which could put a crying baby to sleep(Hyperbole but get
                    my point).If you get invested enough with these characters you will definitely feel emotional at the
                    end of the series. Love this anime.</p>
