                    <p>Hi, My name is Zion, I am 17 years old this year studying in Singapore
                        Polytechnic, I came from a middle/low socio-economic background, 
                            My family always lead a frugal lifestyle and had always told
                         to cherish what I have. What these has led me to become more or less a 
                         stay-at-home boy that enjoys entertainment media provided by electronic device
                         rather than to go out and play, I'm embarrassed to say but I am not the most athletic 
                         person in my family.
                        I hope that I can interest all of you with my website and my recommendation.</p>

                        <h5>More about my hobbies</h5>
                        <p>Well since this website focuses on fun and hobbies, I would like to
                            take this opportunity to talk about it, When I was young I did not play
                            much games or watch many different shows on the internet, i would always
                            just watch any and every shows that pop up on the television, It was around when
                            i was primary 4 that i started to venture out and see if there are different kind 
                            of entertainment that will satisfy me... well, after that it was a straight fall to 
                            abyss. I got hook on numerous western shows and anime and i started to play card games
                            and Blackshot(well, it was popular at one time). However i wasn't hook on to this stuff 
                            until I was in Secondary School, At that time, I thought my life was quite boring, 
                            I decided that i should try out more games/anime/films to enrich myself in life. On
                            the other hand, i could also use the knowledge I gain from enjoying my hobbies to
                            interact with my friends. Right now, i am also trying to make simple pixel art as 
                            a hobby, In fact, all the small icon you see on these website is made by me!

                        <h6>What is this Website about ?</h6>
                        <p>The purpose of the website is to be able to allow you to be able to enjoy one or more
                            of my myriad of recommendation. The recommendation will include fun and thrilling games
                            that will definitely eat up much of your sleep time, or an awesome anime that you can 
                            just sit back on your dinner table and enjoy with your food, prefer something quiet ?
                            you can choose one of the books i recommend to, just be warn that i prefer 
                            darker themed media over happy-go-lucky one, but don't worry, there will be some 
                            light-hearted one too.
